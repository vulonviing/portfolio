# BABE Baseline — RoBERTa Fine-tune Reproduction

Reproduction of sentence-level media bias classification on the BABE dataset (Spinde et al., EMNLP Findings 2021), using RoBERTa-base.

## Goal
Reproduce the binary biased / non-biased sentence classifier from BABE and compare against published baselines:
- Spinde et al. 2021 (distant supervision pre-train + BABE fine-tune): F1 ≈ 0.80
- Krieger et al. 2022 (DA-RoBERTa, JCDL): F1 ≈ 0.81

Target: match or exceed published baselines with a clean RoBERTa-base fine-tune (no distant supervision, no DAPT).

## Results

**5-fold stratified cross-validation on BABE:**

| Model | Macro-F1 |
|---|---|
| Spinde et al. 2021 (distant supervision + BABE) | 0.804 |
| Krieger et al. 2022 (DA-RoBERTa, DAPT, JCDL) | 0.814 |
| **This repo (RoBERTa-base, 5-fold CV)** | **0.857 ± 0.012** |

### K-fold summary

| Metric | Mean ± Std |
|---|---|
| Macro-F1 | 0.857 ± 0.012 |
| Accuracy | 0.858 ± 0.012 |
| Precision (macro) | 0.856 ± 0.011 |
| Recall (macro) | 0.859 ± 0.012 |
| Biased F1 | 0.869 ± 0.011 |

Per-fold macro-F1: 0.876, 0.854, 0.845, 0.852, 0.856. Best fold is `fold_0` with macro-F1 `0.876`, which is the checkpoint selected for Hugging Face release.

### Held-out quick-run evaluation

On a held-out single-split test run (`n=468`), the model reaches `0.870` macro-F1.

|  | Pred non-biased | Pred biased |
|---|---|---|
| True non-biased (207) | 180 | 27 |
| True biased (261) | 33 | 228 |

![Confusion matrix](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vulonviing/babe-roberta-baseline/main/results/confusion_matrix.png)

This quick-run split is slightly optimistic relative to the 5-fold mean, so the cross-validation number is the main result to report. See `results/` for full metrics and error analysis.

## Model access

- Training code and notebooks: [vulonviing/babe-roberta-baseline](https://github.com/vulonviing/babe-roberta-baseline)
- Trained model weights and tokenizer: [vulonviing/roberta-babe-baseline](https://huggingface.co/vulonviing/roberta-babe-baseline)
- GitHub is for code, notebooks, documentation, and result artifacts in `results/`.
- Hugging Face Hub is for the released checkpoint (`fold_0`) and model card.
- Model weights are intentionally **not** stored in git.
- Release notebook: `notebooks/huggingface_upload.ipynb`

## What is excluded from git?

The repo keeps code and lightweight artifacts under version control, but excludes large or regenerable files:

- `models/` for local checkpoints
- `data/raw/` for downloaded source data
- `data/processed/` for regenerated parquet splits
- `wandb/` for experiment logs
- `.venv/` and Python cache files

Download the released model from Hugging Face instead of GitHub:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer

repo_id = "vulonviing/roberta-babe-baseline"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(repo_id)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(repo_id)
```

## Key findings
- A plain RoBERTa-base fine-tune is enough to reproduce the BABE task strongly: 5-fold CV reaches `0.857 ± 0.012` macro-F1, above the published baselines listed above.
- The quick held-out run reaches `0.870` macro-F1, which is slightly optimistic relative to the CV mean but consistent with the same overall result.
- Errors are concentrated in subtle framing and loaded-language cases rather than only overtly emotional or partisan wording.

For details, see:
- `notebooks/02_data_exploration.ipynb` for class balance, length statistics, and sample sentences.
- `notebooks/04_evaluation.ipynb` for confusion matrix, misclassified examples, and error analysis.
- `notebooks/05_final_report.ipynb` for the final comparison table, summary figures, and reporting-ready takeaways.

## Pipeline
The project is a pipeline of 5 notebooks, each calling functions from `src/`. Notebooks are thin orchestrators; logic lives in scripts.

| Notebook | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `01_data_preparation.ipynb` | Download BABE from HuggingFace, clean, split, save processed parquet |
| `02_data_exploration.ipynb` | Class balance, length distributions, vocab stats, sample sentences |
| `03_fine_tuning.ipynb` | Tokenize, fine-tune RoBERTa-base with HF Trainer, log to W&B |
| `04_evaluation.ipynb` | 5-fold CV scores, confusion matrix, error analysis |
| `05_final_report.ipynb` | Final plots and comparison table vs published baselines |

Run notebooks in order. Each is idempotent — re-running won't break the next.

For model release, use `notebooks/huggingface_upload.ipynb`. It is intentionally separate from the numbered pipeline above and only prepares/uploads the final Hugging Face checkpoint.

## Setup
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have a GPU, install the matching `torch` build first. CPU works but training will be slow — Colab / Kaggle recommended for `03_fine_tuning.ipynb`.

## Data
BABE is loaded from HuggingFace: `mediabiasgroup/BABE`. The dataset is publicly licensed for research use; see the dataset card on HF for details. No raw data is committed to git.

## Reproducibility
- Fixed seeds (`src/config.SEED = 42`)
- Pinned dependency versions in `requirements.txt`
- Processed splits saved as parquet so notebooks 02–05 don't re-download
- Final model published to HuggingFace Hub: `vulonviing/roberta-babe-baseline` (after run)
